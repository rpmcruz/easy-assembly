                         Apoo Tester
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The Apoo Tester is an environment to monitoring the execution of a
Virtual Processor Unit.  During the execution of a program, it shows
the contents of the program counter, registers and memory data. The
program in memory is displayed in an Assembly language (not in a
machine language). As is usual with processor units emulators, Apoo
has two memory segments: the program-segment and the data-segment. In
this way, both addresses for program instructions and data will begin
in 0.

Execution:
---------

When the Tester is called with a program file it tries to load and run
it.  If it fails it will display the error in the message line.  If a
"parsing error" occurs, during "Load" the interface will show the text
line in which the error occurred.

When the program is loaded (in memory) you can execute it in three ways:

     - Run: will execute all the instructions 

     - Step: will execute the next instruction and the values of the
       program counter, registers and memory data will be updated; the
       next instruction line, if exists, will have the background
       white

     - Cont: will execute instructions until the next break point

You may set or clear a breakpoint in an instruction by double-clicking
(with the mouse) on its line address number.

The button labeled Clear can be used to clear all breakpoints.

Exit
----

The Apoo Tester will not terminate until the caller terminates.
